# PowerBI-Business-Insights-360

At AtliQ Hardware, a global electronics leader, we're tackling operational challenges by shifting from Excel to a data-driven approach with Power BI and SQL. Excessive reliance on Excel caused losses in some regions, prompting senior management to launch a data analytics project. Using last year's data, our goal is to boost performance and drive improvements.
